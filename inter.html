	<h5>What is RxJS?</h5>
	<p>1.A utility for handling asynchronous data streams.</p>
	<p>2.Like a Promise that can resolve over and over again.</p>
	<h5>RxJS terminology</h5>
	<p>Observable - An array that is built over time.</p>
	<p>Subscription - A for loop that happens over time.</p>
	<p>Emit - When an Observable spits out a value because something subscribed to it.</p>
	<p>Operator - Functions that alter the the way Observables emit values.</p>

	<h5>What is the difference between an observable and a subject?</h5>
	<p>Probably a more important distinction between Subject and Observable is that a Subject has state, it keeps a list of observers. On the other hand, an Observable is really just a function that sets up observation. </p>
	<h5>How would you pass data from a parent component to a child component?</h5>
	<pre>
		export class UserComponent implements OnInit{
		parentMessage: "Gowthaman";
		constructor(){}
		ngOnInit(){

	}
}
slector: 'app-about'
export class AboutComponent implements OnInit{
@Input(): childMessge;
constructor(){}
ngOnInit(){

}
}
< app-about [childMessge]="parentMessage" >< /app-about >
</pre>
<h5>How would you pass data from a child component to a parent component?</h5>
<pre>
	export class ChildComponent implements OnInit{
	@Output() onDatePicked: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter<any>();
		constructor(){}
		ngOnInit(){}
		public pickDate(date: any): void {
		this.onDatePicked.emit(date);
	}
}

</pre>
// parent
<pre>
	< calendar (onDatePicked)="doSomething($event)"></ calendar>
	public doSomething(date: any):void {
	console.log('Picked date: ', date);
}
</pre>
<h5>When do you use template driven vs model driven forms? Why?</h5>
<p>Template-driven forms are asynchronous in nature, whereas Reactive forms are mostly synchronous. In a template-driven approach, most of the logic is driven from the template, whereas in reactive-driven approach, the logic resides mainly in the component or typescript code</p>
<h5>different ways how you would get data to your components from a service and talk about why would you use one way vs the other?</h5>
<p>Using @Input and @Output. </p>
<p>By injecting parent component through constructor or child components through @ViewChild , @ViewChildren , @ContentChild , @ContentChildren and directly calling component's API</p>
<h5>Auth Guard</h5>
<p>
	<p>The auth guard is used to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing restricted routes</p><br>
	<b>CanActivate</b>
	Checks to see if a user can visit a route.
	<br>
	<b>CanActivateChild</b>
	Checks to see if a user can visit a routes children.
	<br>
	<b>CanDeactivate</b>
	Checks to see if a user can exit a route.
	<br>
	<b>Resolve</b>
	Performs route data retrieval before route activation.
	<br>
	<b>CanLoad</b>
	Checks to see if a user can route to a module that lazy loaded.
</p>
<h5>What Is Decorator</h5>
<p>In angular you create classes for everything, be it components, services, directives, etc.
	So, how does angular compiler that compiles your code and transform it into scripts that is ready to be run in browser? This happens because of decorators. In a simple terms, decorators allows you to attach meta data with the type script class using which angular knows whether that class is a component or directive or module or etc.
</p>
<h5>What id Webpack in Angular?</h5>
<p>Webpack is an open source JavaScript module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules</p>
<h5>how you optimizing angular app ?</h5>
<p>1.Optimize main bundle with Lazy Loading</p>
<p>2.Webpack Bundle Analyzer</p>
<p>3.Create several small shared modules</p>
<p>4.Use Lazy Loading for images that are not visible in page</p>
<p>5.Use virtual scrolling for large lists</p>
<p>6.Use FOUT instead of FOIT for fonts</p>
<h5>what is observables ?</h5>
<p>observables as an interface to handle a variety of common asynchronous operations. For example: You can define custom events that send observable output data from a child to a parent component. The HTTP module uses observables to handle AJAX requests and responses
	<br> It is a new way of pushing data in JavaScript</p>
	<h5>What is lazy loading in angular? ?</h5>
	<p>Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated.</p>
	<h5>what is promise in angular?.</h5>
	<h5>What is the difference between observable and promise?.</h5>
	<p>main difference between a promise and an observable is that a promise emits only a single value, whereas an observable emits multiple values.</p>
	<h5>What is redux in angular?.</h5>
	<p>Redux is a pattern/library from the React world that has inspired popular Angular tools like NgRx and NGXS.</p>
	<p>The purpose of redux is to make application data more predictable by creating a one-way data flow</p>
	<h5>What is prototype in JavaScript with example?.</h5>
	<p>When a function is created in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property to the function. This prototype property is an object (called as prototype object) which has a constructor property by default. The constructor property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property</p>
	<p>The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript.</p>
	<h5>What is inheritance in javascript</h5>
	In the classical inheritance, methods from base class get copied into derived class. In JavaScript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object. . The following is a Student class that inherits Person class.
	<h5>Why grid system in bootstrap</h5>
	The Bootstrap Grid System is used for layout, specifically Responsive Layouts. Understanding how it works is vital to understanding Bootstrap. The Grid is made up of groupings of Rows & Columns inside 1 or more Containers. The Bootstrap Grid can be used alone, without the Bootstrap JavaScript and other CSS Components
	<br>
	<p> Bootstrap's grid system uses a set of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.</p>
	<h5>What is promise in angular?</h5>
	In ES6 we have an alternative mechanism built into the language called a promise. A promise is a placeholder for a future value. It serves the same function as callbacks but has a nicer syntax and makes it easier to handle errors.

	<h5>what is viewstate and sesationstate ?</h5>
	<p>Storage The Viewstate is stored within the page itself (in encrypted text), while the Sessionstate is stored in the server. Session is used mainly for storing user specific data [ session specific data ]. ... Viewstate is the type of data that has scope only in the page in which it is used</p>

	<p>localStorage and sessionStorage accomplish the exact same thing and have the same API, but with sessionStorage the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed, while with localStorage the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data</p>


	<h5>Position in css ?</h5>
	<p>The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>

	<h5>foreach and forin ?</h5>
	<p>forEach is an Array method that we can use to execute a function on each</p>
	<p>for...in is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of objects.</p>

	<p>
		number <br>
		bigint <br>
		string <br>
		boolean <br>
		null <br>
		undefined <br>
		object <br>
		symbol <br>

		<h5>ES6 features ?</h5>
		<p>Arrow Functions <br>
			Classes <br>
			Enhanced Object Literals <br>
			String interpolation <br>
			Destructuring <br>
			Default <br>
			Spread <br>
			Spread + Object Literals <br>
			Rest <br>
			Let <br>
			Const <br>
			For..of <br>
			Unicode <br>
			Modules & Module Loaders <br>
			Set <br>
			WeakSet <br>
			Map <br>
			WeakMap <br>
			Proxies <br>
			Symbols <br>
			Inheritable Built-ins <br>
			New Library <br>
			Binary and Octal <br>
			Promises <br>
			Reflect <br>
		Tail Call Optimization</p>
		<h5>Closers in javasript ?</h5>
		<p>Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. </p>

		<h5>What is databing ?</h5>
		<p>Data binding is a core concept in Angular and allows to define communication between a component and the DOM, making it very easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data</p>

		<h5>What is the d/w let and var ?</h5>
		<p>The main difference is the scope difference, while let can be only available inside the scope it's declared, like in for loop, var can be accessed outside the loop for example. ... This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope</p>

		<h5>Why and what is the use of z-index ?</h5>
		<p> front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
		<p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.</p>
		<p> 
			AsyncPipe <br>CurrencyPipe<br> DatePipe<br>DecimalPipe<br> I18nPluralPipe<br> I18nSelectPipe<br> JsonPipe<br> KeyValuePipe <br>LowerCasePipe<br> PercentPipe<br> SlicePipe<br> TitleCasePipe<br> UpperCasePipe<br>

		</p>
		<h5>Set and WeakSet</h5>
		<p><b>Set:</b>- A Set is a collection of values, where each value may occur only once. And main method are add, delete, has, clear and size., <br>

<b>WeakSet:</b>- WeakSet objects allows you to store collection of unique key.“WeakSet” keys cannot be primitive types. Nor they can be created by an array or another set. Values of WeakSet must be object reference.</p>
